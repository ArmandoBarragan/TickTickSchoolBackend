<h2>API usage</h2>
<p>Models of the database are, at the moment, User, Task and Subject.
A neither a task or a subject can be created without any
users, so you need to create a few to test them.</p>
<p>You can call the api in local with the address <code>localhost:8000</code>
and use the following urls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users:
    <ul>
    <li>users/signup/ to create a new user.</li>
    <p>Parameters: email, password, password_confirmation, first_name, last_name</p>
    <li>api-token-auth to get the user's token.</li>
    <p>Parameters: Email and password</p>
    <li>users/{{pk}} to get a user's email, firstname and lastnames</li>
    <li>users/ This does not work. It's only for staff, which has not been planned as a functionality yet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
    Subjects:
    <ul>
    <li>POST subjects/</li>
    Parameters: (Being * a required param) name*, student*, teacher, classroom
    <li>GET subjects/ returns name, student, teacher, classroom.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>
    Tasks:
    <ul>
    <li>POST tasks/</li>
    Parameters: student*, name*, subject*, description, status.
    If a status is not sent, it's set as 'pendiente' as default.
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Authorization</h3>
<p>The project works with token authorization, so for each request it is necessary to set 'Authorization: Token {{token}}'
in it's header.
</p>
<h2>Local installation</h2>
<p>To have this project installed for development purposes, it is necessary to
first install docker and docker compose. To do so, you can follow the given documentation:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/">Docker installation guide on Ubuntu</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">Docker Compose installation guide on Ubuntu.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>After having those installed, you need to cd your way into the project till you are in the root, right next
to the local.yml file, and execute the following command: <code> docker-compose -f local.yml up --build -d</code>.
This command will do just enough if you are working on the frontend and neet to test the API calls. If you want to
run the project as a backend dev, you can either work on it on a container or the Django listener with <code>python3
manage.py runserver</code>. If you opt for the container option, you will probably want to export the file variable 
every session so that you don't have to write <code>-f local.yml</code>. You can do this by executing the following
command: <code>export COMPOSE_FILE=local.yml</code>.
</p>
<h2>Project deployment</h2>
<p>For deployment it is as necessary to have docker and docker compose installed as it is needed on development.
You, as well, need to cd your way into the root of the project. Environment variables have to be changed
on the production.yml file.</p>
